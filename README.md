"DSfB Project Part 4.ipynb" Contains a completed Data Science project based on plot
diversity in Germany


"ggsashimi ouput" contains a loop to run through one of my research dataframes and create 
an image output (Using ggsashimi published by "Guigo Lab")


"Jonathan_Forsyth_DFCI_Coding_Assesment.ipynb" is a coding assesment I recently filled out for Dana-Farber
Cancer institute


"Machine_Learning_Project" contains multiple files for a Convolutional Neural Network project.
NIST_scraper collected molecule spectral links which was combined with the labelled dataset.
NIST_downloader then downloaded the spectra from those links.
Data_visualizer creates a 200x200 spectral image based on the spectral file.
"Full_Code" contains the full training and design of the CNN.
